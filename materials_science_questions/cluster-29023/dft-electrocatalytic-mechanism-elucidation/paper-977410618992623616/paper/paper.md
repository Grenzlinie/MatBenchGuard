Abstract

Electrocatalytic CO₂ reduction technology is key to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and
the energy crisis. However, controlling the selectivity of CO₂RR products at low overpotential
remains a challenge. In this paper, we predicted five high-performance CO₂RR electrocatalysts
with different product-specific selectivities at the theoretical level based on the advantages of
the compositional structure and the tunable pore size of 2D $\pi$-conjugated MOFs. In addition,
through the reaction mechanism and electronic structure analysis, we found that the synergistic
interaction between metal atoms and organic linkers of 2D MOFs can effectively regulate the
electronic structure of the active center. Their pore size as well as the diversity of carbon
materials can regulate the spin magnetic moments of the metal atoms, thus affecting the
improvement of their catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the oxygen or carbon affinity of the
catalyst surface determines the differences in the formation of key intermediates, which
ultimately determines the reaction path and product selectivity. These insights we present will
be useful for the development and design of highly active CO₂RR electrocatalysts.

### 1 Introduction

Large emissions of $CO_2$ gas exacerbate environmental problems, such as the greenhouse effect and ocean acidification.$^{[1]}$ Electrocatalytic $CO_2$ reduction reaction ($CO_2$RR) can drive the production of high value-added chemicals and fuels, which can effectively alleviate energy stress and environmental degradation by using these renewable energies.$^{[2-4]}$ However, the actual yields of final products from $CO_2$RR are not satisfactory, because of the stable C=O bonds in linear non-polar $CO_2$ molecule resulting in the slow reaction kinetics, the low Faraday efficiency due to competing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and many by-product outputs.$^{[5-7]}$ Therefore, finding and designing an efficient $CO_2$RR electrocatalyst with high activity and specific selectivity remains a challenge.

The carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) have promising applications in a variety of electrochemical reactions due to their high electrical conductivity, large atomic utilization and low costs.$^{[8-10]}$ The performance of active metal centers can also be controlled by adjusting the local coordination environment, such as changing the coordination atoms and the number of coordination sites and inducing defects.$^{[11,12]}$ He *et al.* reported that an N-doped carbon-based Pd SACs could reduce $CO_2$ to CO, in which Pd-N$_4$ as an active center was more favorable than that of a single Pd.$^{[13]}$ Yang *et al.* found that the difference in coordination number formed by Cu embedded in $C_3N_4$ could significantly modulate the selectivity of $CO_2$RR, in which the Cu-N$_4$ active center effectively improved the selectivity of $CH_3OH$ by up to 95.5%.$^{[14]}$ In addition, Sun *et al.* investigated a series of TM-X$_4$ (X=S and N) as active centers in carbon-based SACs for $CO_2$RR, where CoS$_4$ could selectively reduce $CO_2$ molecules to form HCOOH molecules, with a low limiting potential of -0.07 V.$^{[15]}$ Although the TM-X$_4$ as active centers in carbon-based SACs is efficient for $CO_2$RR, the role of TM, X, and C configurations in determining $CO_2$RR activity and product selectivity remains elusive and unclear. Moreover, achieving large-scale accurate preparation of TM-X$_4$ SACs remains a major challenge due to the lack of precise and controllable synthetic methods and characterization tools.

Two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are composed of metal ions and organic ligands and have well-defined structural features$^{[16]}$. 2D MOFs have been extensively studied in catalysis due to their well-defined structures, high thermal stability, and fascinating physical and chemical properties.$^{[17]}$ In particular, 2D conjugated MOFs have a scalable $\pi$-d

conjugated structure, giving them high electrical conductivity, and tunable composition, morphology, and porosity also provide a simple means to manipulate their catalytic properties.[18] Therefore, the specific active centers and coordination environments in 2D conjugated MOFs could provide a viable research platform for understanding the catalytic mechanisms of $CO_2$RR.[19] Liu et al. designed and synthesized a highly symmetric hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA)-Cu-based conjugated MOFs with $Cu-O_4$ active centers, which exhibits the high selectivity of 78% for the electrocatalytic reduction of $CO_2$ to form $CH_4$.[20] Moreover, Majidi et al. reported that the $Cu-O_4$ active center in 2D conjugated MOFs of copper tetrahydroxyquinone could achieve a Faraday efficiency of 91% for the reduction of $CO_2$ to form CO.[21] Zhong et al. found that the $Zn-O_4$ active center formed by Zn atom-doped phthalocyanine-$Cu-O_8$ could effectively improve the selectivity of $CO_2$ reduction to CO.[22] Although these works demonstrate that 2D conjugated MOFs could be used as the electrocatalytic candidates for $CO_2$RR, their atomic-scale effect of the active center in determining catalytic activity and product selectivity remains unclear. Therefore, understanding the key factors that influence the catalytic efficiency of 2D conjugated MOFs will greatly facilitate screening and designing electrocatalysts for $CO_2$RR.

We herein investigated the $CO_2$RR performance of $TM-X_4$ (TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu； X =N, O, S and Se) active centers in three types of 2D conjugated MOFs with different porous sizes by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Some 2D conjugated MOFs were confirmed as high-performance electrocatalysts with specific selectivity for $CO_2$RR by tuning metals, ligands and porous sizes. Meanwhile, the structure-activity relationships of 2D conjugated MOFs for $CO_2$RR were illustrated by analyzing their electronic properties. Our results provide theoretical insights for the development of 2D conjugated MOFs as efficient electrocatalysts for $CO_2$RR.

## 2 Results and discussion
### 2.1 Geometric stability

Based on the experimentally prepared 2D MOFs[17,23-25], we investigated three types of 2D MOFs with the $TM-X_4$ active centers but different pore sizes, as shown in Figure 1. Metal ions and phenyl-like molecules (including HIB, HHB, HTB, and HSB) can couple to form two types

of 2D MOFs with different pore configurations, namely $TM_3HXB$ and $TM_3HXB_2$ (X = I, H, T, and S), respectively. And the triphenyl organic ligands (including HITP, HHTP, HTTP, HSTP) can couple metal ions to form the larger pore configurations of 2D MOFs, $TM_3HXTP_2$. Although these 2D MOFs have the homogeneous distribution of TM-X₄ active centers, the densities of TM-X₄ active centers are different due to different organic ligands bonding TM to form pore sizes. Eight 3d metals, including Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu atoms, were chosen as the targets, based on recent experimental studies.[26-29] Therefore, we would study the CO₂RR performance of 96 2D MOFs from eight metals combined with eight organic ligands. The lattice parameters of these 2D MOFs were optimized, as shown in Table S1.

The blue, red, grey and white spheres represent transition metal (TM), coordinated atom (X), carbon atom and hydrogen atom respectively. The unit cell is denoted by black dotted line.

The stability of the catalyst is the first important factor in catalytic reactions. 2D MOFs are easily susceptible to metal agglomeration during their preparation due to the high surface energy of the metal atoms. Therefore, the structural stability of these 2D MOFs was first assessed by calculating the formation energies of metal atoms and ligands, as shown in Figure

2a. The results show negative formation energies for all structures, indicating that the coupling of metal atoms and ligands is more thermodynamically favorable compared to the formation of metal clusters. In addition, as an electrocatalyst not only thermodynamic stability but also electrochemical stability is required. Therefore, the electrochemical stability of these 2D MOFs have to be considered. The negative dissociation potential of the metals indicates that the metal atoms tend to precipitation and then lead to structural instability under electrochemical conditions. The following studies of the CO₂RR electrochemical process only considered those thermodynamically and electrochemically stable 2D MOFs.

### 2.2 Electrocatalytic CO₂RR mechanisms

The reaction mechanisms of CO₂ reduction involve are complicated and their products are diverse, due to multiple electron processes and various intermediates. Therefore, the investigation of CO₂RR mechanisms on 2D MOFs is important for further controlling and improving the catalytic activity of 2D MOFs. Because the CO₂ molecule is non-polar and has

strong thermodynamic stability, the first hydrogenation process in CO₂RR is regarded as the key step, which takes place in the electrolyte solution in the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, i.e., $* + \text{CO}_2(\text{g}) + \text{H}^+ + \text{e}^- \rightarrow *\text{COOH}/*\text{HCOO}^{[30-32]}$. From the view of the ligands in 2D MOFs, the NH coordination in these 2D MOFs is more favorable for the first hydrogenation of CO₂ than that of the O, S, and Se coordination. From the view of the metals in 2D MOFs, the first hydrogenation of CO₂ is more difficult with the increased valence electrons in the metal outer layer, as shown in Figure 2b-2d. Moreover, for the competing HER, TM₃HXB₂ and TM₃HXTP₂ are more favorable for HER than that of TM₃HXB, due to the unsaturated coordination environment of ligands in TM₃HXB₂ and TM₃HXTP₂. Therefore, the catalytic activity of these 2D MOFs could be controlled by metallic atoms, ligands, and their coordination environment.

The proton-electron pair ($\text{H}^+ + e$) is involved in each elementary step of the CO₂RR. The different hydrogenation pathways will lead to various products. Moreover, the competitive selectivity exists between HER and each hydrogenation of CO₂RR under the same reaction conditions, these factors will affect the Faraday efficiency of CO₂RR. We first studied HER and the first three hydrogenation processes of CO₂RR on 76 stable 2D MOFs as CO₂RR electrocatalysts with specific selectivity and high performance, as shown in Figure 3.

The lower Gibbs free energy is more selective, based on the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationship.$^{[33,34]}$ We screened 26 2D MOFs by comparing the first hydrogenation of $CO_2$ and HER, as shown in Figure 3b. The formation of HCOO on 25 2D MOFs are favorable, except for $Co_3HIB$, which was favorable to form COOH. We then screened 17 2D MOFs by comparing the hydrogenation of HCOO and COOH, as well as HER, as shown in Figure 3c. The H atom combines with either the O atom of HCOO or the C atom of COOH to form HCOOH, while the H atom combines with OH of COOH to form CO and $H_2O$. The strong adsorption of HCOOH and CO can be as intermediates on 2D MOFs for the next hydrogenation processes. In particular, the hydrogenation of HCOO on $Cu_3HIB_2$ and $Cu_3HITP_2$ forms HCOOH, which is directly released and there are no by-products, as shown in Figure 4a and 4b. Meanwhile, the hydrogenation of COOH on $Co_3HIB$ favorably forms CO. Previous works demonstrated *CO is a key intermediate for the formation of C-C coupling into multi-carbon products,$^{[35]}$ which is

difficult for most SACs. Therefore, we only considered single carbon products in this work. We finally screened five 2D MOFs, including $Ni_3HHB$, $Co_3HIB$, $Cr_3HTB$, $Ti_3HITP_2$, and $V_3HITP_2$, by comparing the hydrogenation of HCOOH and CO and HER, as shown in Figure 3d. This hydrogenation process on these 5 2D MOFs favorably forms CHO.

The CO₂RR mechanisms on $Ni_3HHB$, $Co_3HIB$, $Cr_3HTB$, $Ti_3HITP_2$ and $V_3HITP_2$ were further investigated, as shown in Figure 4c-4e and Figure S1. The H atoms favorably bond to the C atom of the intermediate than that of the O atom on $Ni_3HHB$. In the formation of $CH_2O$ by CHO hydrogenation, $CH_2O$ as the final product will be released due to its weak physical adsorption on $Ni_3HHB$, as shown in Figure 4c. The first hydrogenation of $CO_2$ is the rate-limiting step and its limiting potential is -0.62 V. The most favorable reaction path is $CO_2 \rightarrow *HCOO \rightarrow *HCOOH \rightarrow *CHO \rightarrow CH_2O$. Our results show that the final products on $Co_3HIB$, $Cr_3HTB$, $Ti_3(HITP)_2$ and $V_3(HITP)_2$ are $CH_4$ by eight hydrogenation steps, but their most favorable reaction pathway and rate-limiting step were different. The formation of CHOH by

the CHO hydrogenation on Co₃HIB is rate-limiting step and its limiting potential is -0.62 V.
The most favorable reaction pathway for CO₂RR on Co₃HIB is CO₂ → *COOH → *CO → *CHO → *CHOH → *CH₂OH → *CH₃OH → *CH₃ → CH₄. The formation of *HCOOH by the *HCOO hydrogenation on Cr₃HTB, Ti₃HITP₂ and V₃HITP₂ is rate-limiting step and their limiting potential are -0.29V, -0.69V, and -0.44 V, respectively. The most favorable reaction pathway for CO₂RR on Cr₃HTB, Ti₃HITP₂ and V₃HITP₂ is CO₂ → *HCOO → *HCOOH → *CHO → *CH2O → *CH3O → *O+CH4 → *OH → H₂O. In particular, a strong adsorption of H₂O on Ti₃HITP₂ and V₃HITP₂ results in the deactivation of TM-X₄ active centers, thus reducing the catalytic efficiency of these 2D MOFs.

In consequence, the C₁ products on five 2D MOFs and their limiting potentials (U_L) of their rate-limiting steps are summarized in Figure 5a. Ni₃HHB has the highest selectivity of the CH₂O product with a U_L of -0.62V. Co₃HIB has excellent catalytic activity and selectivity with a small U_L of -0.24V. Cu₃HIB₂ has the best performance for the production of HCOOH with the lowest U_L of -0.03 V.

### 2.3 Catalytic activity and selectivity of CO₂RR

The charge transfer occurs between the valence electrons of the TMs active center and the reactants or adsorbed intermediates play an important role in elementary reaction. In order to study the origin of the catalytic performance of 2D MOFs for CO₂RR, the relationship between the Bader charge of TMs and the change of Gibbs free energy of the first hydrogenation of CO₂ into COOH/HCOO was calculated, as shown in Figure 5b. The positive charge of the transition metal is regulated by the metal atom and the coordination environment. With the increase of the positive charge of the metal atom, the energy required for the CO₂RR protonation process decreases and the catalytic performance is improved. However, it is worth noting that the more positive charges carried by the metal will also lead to stronger adsorption with the product and increase the difficulty of product release. In summary, too large or too small charge of metal atoms will reduce the catalytic efficiency. Interestingly, the five high-efficiency catalysts screened by high-throughput have similar metal charge of about -1.0e.

Although these five high-performance catalysts have similar metal charge, the selectivity of their CO₂RR products is quite different. In the first step of CO₂RR protonation, the more positively charged the active metal is the more favorable it is for CO₂ protonation to form *HCOO and vice versa for CO₂ protonation to form *COOH as shown in Figure 5b. The key factor for the formation of different intermediates is the difference in the adsorption of O and C by the catalyst; when the adsorption strength of O on the catalyst surface is much stronger than that of C, the active centers preferentially bind to O atoms and vice versa, as shown in Figure 5.5c. In addition, the stronger adsorption of the catalyst with O or C atoms will also

enhance the strength of adsorption on the reaction intermediates, pushing the $CO_2$RR towards a multi-electron reaction, as shown in Figure 5d-e.

In order to further understand the origin of catalytic activity, we studied the partial density of states of the five 2D MOFs candidate catalysts, as shown in Figure S2. In all of these catalysts, the partial-wave DOS crosses the Fermi energy level (0 eV), thus all of these candidate catalysts have metal properties and are capable of transporting electrons faster in the electrocatalytic process. In addition, the d orbitals of metals near the Fermi energy level show higher peaks compared to the p orbitals of other coordination atoms and carbon atoms, suggesting that metal atoms are more reactive. As a result, the role of the five d orbitals of the metal center in the first step of $CO_2$ protonation was comparatively analyzed, as shown in Figure 6a-e. The results show that the d orbitals of the metal atoms are acted upon by the crystal field of the coordination environment to form different splitting energy levels. Among them, $Co_3HIB$, $Cr_3HTB$ and $Ni_3HHB$ split metal d orbitals with strong hybridization near the Fermi energy level. Among them, the vertical orbital $dz^2$ is the highest energy orbital. Whereas the Cu-d orbitals of $Cu_3HITP_2$ and $Cu_3HIB_2$ split into discrete energy levels compared to $Cu_3HIB$, this change mainly depends on the long-range interactions of the carbon materials. Comparison of the changes in the metal d orbitals before and after COOH/HCOO adsorption reveals that all d orbitals are involved to some extent in the catalytic process, but the decisive role is played by the vertical orbital $dz^2$. We believe that this is due to the spatial structure of the $dz^2$ orbitals which is vertically oriented with a large number of wavefunctions concentrated at the two ends, which is more conducive to the adsorption and activation of the reaction intermediates.

(g) The fitting relationship between the magnetic moment of metal atoms and the change of Gibbs free energy of the first hydrogenation of CO₂ into COOH/HCOO.

The interaction of different metals and organic linkers can effectively modulate the electronic structure of metal atoms and thus affect the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates at the active center. In order to understand the reason for having the same active center but different catalytic activities, the study compared the PDOS of Cu₃HIB, Cu₃HIB₂, and Cu₃HITP₂ with the same Cu-N₄ catalytic active center as shown in Figure 6d-f. The first step protonation of all three is more inclined to produce HCOO, but the energy required for the reaction varies widely 1.20 eV, 0.03 eV, and 0.55 eV, respectively. It can be seen from the PDOS results that Cu₃HITP₂ and Cu₃HIB₂ have a strong spin polarization, and the 3d orbitals of metal

Cu cleave at the Fermi energy level to form a portion of the spin-up occupied and a partially spin-down unoccupied orbital. The ability to activate $CO_2$ is attributed to the synergistic interaction between the unoccupied and occupied d-orbitals in the metal, resulting in an "accept and donate" mechanism between the metal and the reactants.$^{[36]}$ In the "accept" process, electrons from the reactants are transferred to the empty d orbitals of the metal. Subsequently, the electrons in the occupied d-orbitals of the metal atom return to the antibonding orbitals of the reactants. Thus, the metal atom in the "accept and donate" process can act as an active site to weaken the C-O bond of the $CO_2$ molecule and strengthen the bonding process between the metal and the reaction intermediate. The incompletely occupied orbitals near the Fermi energy level of $Cu_3HITP_2$ and $Cu_3HIB_2$ are more conducive to the acceptance and transfer of electrons, thus improving the catalytic activity. It can also be seen that the peak at the Fermi energy level on $Cu_3HIB_2$ is shifted to the left compared to $Cu_3HITP_2$ resulting in partial occupation of the spin-down unoccupied orbitals, indicating that the Cu atoms of $Cu_3HIB_2$ are more prone to provide electrons to the reaction intermediates to promote the catalytic reaction.

Comparing the five high-performance catalysts screened above, it is found that they all have strong spin polarization phenomenon, and in order to explore the effect of spin polarization on the catalytic performance, the relationship between the catalytic activity and the spin magnetic moment of these five different pores with the same active center was further comparatively analyzed as shown in Figure 6g. The results show that the catalytic activity is lower for catalysts with zero magnetic moment of transition metal atoms in the active center. The catalytic activity increases exponentially with the increase of the spin magnetic moment of the metal atom. In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that spin state changes have a significant effect on adsorption and catalytic properties.$^{[37, 38]}$ However, spin modulation is usually realized by heteroatom doping and surface modification.$^{[38, 39]}$ Our study found that changes in pore and carbon material size also significantly affect the spin state of 2D MOFs, which will suggest new ideas for spin state modulation.

## 3 Conclude

In summary, we explored the $CO_2RR$ catalytic activity and selectivity on three types of 2D MOF materials including $TM_3HXB$, $TM_3HXB_2$, and $TM_3HXTP_2$ (TM=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,

Ni, Cu; X=I, H, T, S) with different pores of TM-X₄ active center. By tuning the composition of the metal and ligand molecules, five high-performance CO₂RR catalysts with different selectivities were found, Cu₃HIB₂ and Cu₃HITP₂ with HCOOH products, Ni₃HHB with CH₂O products, and Co₃HIB and Cr₃HTB with CH₄ products. Synergistic interactions between the metal and ligand atoms can efficiently tune the electronic structure of the active metal. In addition, the diversity of carbon structures can modulate the spin states of metal atoms, which can affect not only the magnetic moments but also the catalytic properties of the materials. Differences in O or C affinity on the catalyst surface determine the CO₂RR pathway and product selectivity. Our insights will be useful for the development and optimization of highly active CO₂RR electrocatalysts.

## 4 calculation method
All spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.[⁴⁰] The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was adopted for the exchange-correlation functional and the plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV was employed.[⁴¹⁻⁴³] The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used to model the ion-electron interaction.[⁴⁴] The convergence criterion for the energy and force were set to $10^{-5}$ eV and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively. The DFT-D3 correction was adopted to illustrate the dispersion correction for the van der Waals (vdW) weak interactions.[⁴⁵] To avoid the interactions between two adjacent periodic units, the vacuum thickness of 15 Å in the z-direction was inserted. For TM₃HXB, TM₃HXB₂, and TM₃HXTP₂, the Brillouin zone of geometric optimizations was sampled by a $\Gamma$-point grid of 3×5×1, 3×3×1, and 2×2×1 and the Brillouin zone of electronic properties calculations was sampled by a $\Gamma$-point grid of 7×9×1, 7×7×1, and 5×5×1, respectively.[⁴⁶] An implicit solvent model is used to the effects of the water solvent environment using VASPsol with the dielectric constant set to 78.54 F/m.[⁴⁷] Calculation details for the formation energy (Eբ), the dissolution potential (U_diss), adsorption energies, Gibbs free energy, and limiting potential can be found in Supporting Information.
